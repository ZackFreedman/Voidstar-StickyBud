# Voidstar StickyBud

The magnetic earbud dock for Google Glass! Learn more and buy one at https://www.tindie.com/products/VoidstarLab/stickybud-the-earbud-dock-for-google-glass/ . Bring your earbud near the magnet and it snaps into place. Give it a gentle pull and it comes off. It's so satisfying, man.

The StickyBuds we ship to buyers are printed with 0.20mm layer height, 100% infill, 2 shells, no supports, no raft, filament fan on, in PLA on blue tape lightly sprayed with denatured alcohol.

Make sure you accurately level your build plate - the thickness of the first two layers are important.

To complete the build, secure a [1/4"x1/16" neodymium disc magnet](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0012AUU84/ref=oh_details_o05_s00_i01?ie=UTF8&psc=1) into the recess. Be sure to test it against the earbud first so you attach it the right way! Use a high-strength cyanoacrylate glue like Zap-a-Gap for a more durable bond.
